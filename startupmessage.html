<h1>Jamba Release Notes / News</h1>
<br/>
<h2>Cross Realm Support Added</h2>
<br/>
<p>* Jamba 6.0.3-1 and up have cross realm character support.</p>
<p>* Character names now must be in name-server format, .e.g. Jafula-Caelestrasz</p>
<p>* Cross realm teams must make sure /jamba > Advanced > Core: Communications > Assume All Team Members Always Online is checked.
    Remember to reload your UI after making this change.</p>
<p>* This introduced quite a few bugs. Sorry :-( I'm working on fixing them as I am made aware of them.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Having Problems With Your Teams?</h2>
<br/>
<p>* Remember to do the following fixes on every character in your team!</p>
<p>* If your team list is full of empty lines, please reset the current profile. Warning this will require you to configure everything again. You can
reset the current profile with the following button: /jamba > Profiles > Core: Profiles > Reset Profile</p>
<p>* Make sure to add characters into your team list with their name, followed by a dash and the server the character is on. e.g. Jafula-Caelestrasz</p>
<br/>
<h2>ISBoxer Users</h2>
<br/>
<p>* Please make sure your ISBoxer version is ISBoxer 41.10.1115.1 or higher.</p>
<p>* When ISBoxer manages your Jamba Team for you, it will add the characters with the correct name format if you have filled out the server name in your ISBoxer character.</p>
